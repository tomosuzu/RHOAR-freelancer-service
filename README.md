# FreelancerService
## Property

## Technology
* Spring Boot runtime
* PostgreSQL database

## Explain my design

I created these endpoints.
I chose simple design for entity.
List of skills should be List, but I didn't so.
Because I think this is too much and too predict.
If I create the freelancer add method, I use comma delimiter.

* get "freelancers"
```bash
curl http://freelancer-service-tosuzuki-freelancer.apps.na311.openshift.opentlc.com/freelancers
```

* get "freelancer"
```bash
curl http://freelancer-service-tosuzuki-freelancer.apps.na311.openshift.opentlc.com/freelancers/329299
```
